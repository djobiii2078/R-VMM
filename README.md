# R-VMM
**Resilient Virtual Machine Monitor** is a complete fault tolerance solution for type-I hypervisors adopting one of the most popular VMM architectures, we refer as "pVM-based". This project leverages unikernel and fault tolerance designs to have deal with the fault tolerance of the "dom0" in the Xen virtualization system.

## Our design

We split the pVM (dom0) in four parts where each part has his dedicated fault tolerance mecanism + a global loop which monitors via heartbeat and trigger recovery mechanisms.
